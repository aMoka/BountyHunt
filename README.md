BountyHunt
==========
Bounty Hunting Game Mode System created for servers running TShock.

v. 0.0.2.0 - Bugs and (most of) SEconomy
----------------------------------------
* Most of the commands are sorted out. Sadly /bty -info seems to mess up because...
* ... it keeps adding to list wrong. Though I think I know what it is.
* Bounty completion/failures still untested.
* Other minor bug fixes. 

v. 0.0.1.0 - BareBones 
----------------------
* Engine dependent on how I think PacketTypes.KillMe and PacketTypes.PlayerDamage works.
* SEconomy still needs to be figured out.
* All commands should work beautifully.
* No testing thus far (yey!).
